With a plan set, Nova and friends embark on a hilarious quest. From misunderstanding government jargon to awkward encounters with the Fest crew, the adventure is filled with laughs.

In a final twist, Nova has to decide how far to take it. Do they risk everything by confronting the government on live TV or play it safe?

Choice 5: Final Decision

    Option A: Challenge the government directly on-air, sparking a nationwide movement.
